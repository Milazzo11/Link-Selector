A program to randomly select links in a text file of data.

The example LINK.txt file contains data for various .onion sites, and this program will randomly select one of these links.
Furthermore, links labeled "offline" by typing the word "offline" on the same line as the link can be removed from the LINK.txt file if needed.

This program doesn't have too many practical applications, but it is certainly fun to generate random links from website databases and see where they take you.
